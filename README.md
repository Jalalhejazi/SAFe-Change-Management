# SAFe-Change-Management



The **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)** and **Dr. John Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model** are both comprehensive frameworks designed to facilitate large-scale organizational change. While SAFe is primarily focused on scaling Agile practices across enterprises, Kotter’s model provides a structured approach to managing change effectively. Understanding the correlation between these two frameworks can help organizations implement SAFe more successfully by leveraging proven change management principles.

### **Overview of SAFe Framework**

**SAFe** is a set of organization and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and Agile practices. It integrates principles from Agile, Lean, and DevOps to improve productivity, quality, and time-to-market. SAFe is structured into several configurations (Essential, Large Solution, Portfolio, and Full SAFe) to accommodate different organizational sizes and complexities.

Key Components of SAFe:

1. **Team Level**: Agile teams operate using Scrum, Kanban, or other Agile methodologies.
2. **Program Level**: Multiple teams work together in an Agile Release Train (ART) to deliver value.
3. **Large Solution Level**: Coordinates multiple ARTs for complex solutions.
4. **Portfolio Level**: Aligns strategy and execution, managing investments and governance.

### **Overview of Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model**

**Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model** is a sequential approach to implementing successful change within an organization. It emphasizes the importance of preparation, execution, and sustaining change.

The 8 Steps:

1. **Create a Sense of Urgency**: Highlight the need for change to motivate stakeholders.
2. **Build a Guiding Coalition**: Form a powerful group to lead the change effort.
3. **Form a Strategic Vision and Initiatives**: Develop a clear vision and strategy to guide the change.
4. **Enlist a Volunteer Army**: Encourage widespread support and participation.
5. **Enable Action by Removing Barriers**: Eliminate obstacles that impede progress.
6. **Generate Short-Term Wins**: Achieve and celebrate small victories to build momentum.
7. **Sustain Acceleration**: Keep pushing for more change to ensure long-term success.
8. **Institute Change**: Embed the changes into the organizational culture.

### **Correlation Between SAFe and Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model**

1. **Create a Sense of Urgency**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe emphasizes the need for organizations to respond swiftly to market changes and customer needs. Implementing SAFe often starts with recognizing the urgency to improve agility and competitiveness.
2. **Build a Guiding Coalition**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe recommends establishing a Lean-Agile Center of Excellence (LACE) or similar groups comprising key stakeholders and leaders to guide and support the transformation.
3. **Form a Strategic Vision and Initiatives**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe requires the creation of a clear vision at the Portfolio level, aligning strategic themes with business objectives to guide Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and teams.
4. **Enlist a Volunteer Army**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe promotes engaging teams and individuals across the organization to participate in the transformation, fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
5. **Enable Action by Removing Barriers**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe identifies and removes impediments through roles like Release Train Engineers (RTEs) and Product Owners, ensuring teams have the resources and support needed to succeed.
6. **Generate Short-Term Wins**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe encourages delivering incremental value through Program Increments (PIs) and celebrating achievements at the end of each PI, which helps build momentum and demonstrate the benefits of Agile practices.
7. **Sustain Acceleration**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe supports ongoing improvement through regular retrospectives, Inspect & Adapt workshops, and scaling Agile practices, ensuring that the transformation continues to evolve and mature.
8. **Institute Change**
    
    - **SAFe Correlation**: SAFe aims to embed Agile principles and Lean-Agile culture into the organization’s DNA, making these practices a fundamental part of how the business operates and delivers value.
